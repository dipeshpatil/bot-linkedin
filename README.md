## How to use QueryBuilder Effectively
You need to provide a query in this sequence
```
Entity -> Keywords -> Companies -> Locations
```
Where
```
First Parameter: Entity (String)
Second Paramater: Keywords (List)
Third Parameter: Companies (List)
Fourth Parameter: Locations (List)
```

Example 1:
```
People -> [Recruiter, Talent Acquistition] -> [Google, Microsoft] -> [Bangalore, Pune]
```

Example 2:
```
People -> [Software Engineer, SDE] -> [Microsoft, Amazon, Google] -> [Bangalore, Pune]
```

Then input the number of followers

Example
```30```
